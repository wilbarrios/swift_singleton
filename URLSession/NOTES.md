> In basic terms, humans communicate through a process of encoding and decoding. The **encoder** is the person who develops and sends the message.

The **encoder** uses a ‘medium’ to send the message to an *audience* — a phone call, email, text message, face-to-face meeting, or other communication tool.

The *audience* then ‘decodes’, or interprets, the message for themselves. Decoding is the process of turning communication into thoughts. For example, you may realize you’re hungry and encode the following message to send to your roommate: “I’m hungry. Do you want to get pizza tonight?”

## Decodable protocol

> A type that can decode itself **from** an external representation.

## Encodable protocol 

> A type that can encode itself **to** an external representation.

[Encoding and Decoding Custom Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types)

We can say... when we `POST` data, we need to **encode** it, when we receive or `GET` data, we **decode** that data.
